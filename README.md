Reflection on what worked well and what challenges you faced. 
  - Some challenges I faced was when I had to measure all the dimensions
    for my course so that I could make a percise code. Anotehr challenge
    was that I had to learn how to use VEX EXP code and that took me while
    Some things that worked out well was making the obsticle course and adding
    it all to my GITHUB repository.
