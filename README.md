**How your BaseBot interacts with each obstacle.** 

    My whole course has 6 set obsticles. My first obsticle the robot has to
    dodge the piller set around the corrner. Then it has to jump/run over 2
    ramps. It also has to run through a block tower  and has to contiue 
    dodging the the pillars set ahead near the turn. Now the robot has to collect
    the 2 balls laying around and has to put them in the ball house and continue 
    to the finish line.

    
**How to run your Python script. **
  
    Copy and paste the (.py) code into vex exp code

**Reflection on what worked well and what challenges you faced. **
   
    Some challenges I faced was when I had to measure all the dimensions
    for my course so that I could make a percise code. Anotehr challenge
    was that I had to learn how to use VEX EXP code and that took me while
    Some things that worked out well was making the obsticle course and adding
    it all to my GITHUB repository.
